# KSP-inspired rocket simulator made in C++.

A rocket will be represented using a master class. Modular parts represented by separate classes can be added to the base class to emulate the construction of an overall rocket system, including pilots.

The rocket system can be sent to a predetermined destinations with levels of success or failure reported. Assumptions about environment and part behavior will be established as the project is built.
